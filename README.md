## :bookmark_tabs: Generator Hierarchy
### ðŸ”˜Top-level: src/bag_sar_vco_adc/top
- Top-level single-channel ADC and time-interleaved array generation.
###  ðŸ”˜AR ADC: src/bag_sar_vco_adc/sar
- `sar_async_clkgen`: Dynamic NAND gate-based asynchronous clock generator for asynchronous SAR.
- `sar_cdac`: Capacitive DAC, includes unit MFC capacitor, unit capacitor driver, different switching scheme
- `sar_comp/sar_comp_match`: Comparators with common-centroid layout implementation include building blocks such as pre-amplifier and dynamic latches, which can be used to build different comparator variants
